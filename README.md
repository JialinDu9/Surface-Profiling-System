# Surface Profiling System Design Project

## Authors

- Jialin Du
- Zhuoluo Zhang

## Description

This project is developed as part of a laboratory exercise on surface profiling systems. It consists of two main Jupyter notebooks:

- `Projector.ipynb`: This notebook is responsible for generating patterns for structured illumination. It includes the code necessary to produce various lighting patterns used in the surface profiling process.

- `Capture.ipynb`: This notebook is used for capturing images, analyzing the data, and generating 3D surface diagrams. It contains the procedures for image acquisition, data processing, and visualization of the results.

These notebooks are designed to be used in conjunction with the lab reports, which provide detailed explanations of the concepts, methodologies, and results.
